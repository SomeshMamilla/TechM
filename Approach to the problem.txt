After several multiple linear regression model, I understood this requires
1. advanced feature engineering
2. strong ensemble model
3. patience

#The idea is to build a randomforest boosted with heavy weights, also known as Xtreme Gradient Boosted Random Forest

This will return an accuracy of 94%

-----Good luck------
